# Crop Pest and Disease Data API (AgDxAPI)

## Background

AgDx is a newly formed alliance initiated by several CGIAR centers, PlantVillage and EDDMaps which are publicly funded, non-profit organizations dedicated to research for development and education in agriculture with the aim to improve plant health globally through ICT tools.

As an alliance of individual platforms, tools and databases aimed at supporting agricultural health in different aspects, AgDx has committed to address these shortcomings through the development of Application Program Interfaces (API&#39;s) to facilitate sharing of data between platforms and/or by providing links between complementary ICT tools where appropriate.

To initiate this process, minimum data elements for exchange between alliance databases and applications are determined, and harmonize these with existing data standards and ontologies to develop and document a standardized web service API specification.

## Objective:

Create data exchange standards, and a REST API (dubbed AgDxAPI) for plant pest and disease data held in disparate databases and applications.

Collaboration among a community of developers of pest and disease databases and applications and the CGIAR Platform on Big Data in Agriculture.

It will build on existing data standards for Agriculture, such as the Crop and Agronomy ontologies.

## Tasks

1. Review data structures in existing pest and disease databases and applications and recommend a minimum set of data for interoperability and exchange.
2. Participate in requirements gathering via agile methodologies to define functional and non-functional requirements.
3. Review existing data definition standards and ontologies from the CGIAR, Academia, and development organizations like FAO for reuse in defining data exchange attributes for the AgDxAPI.
4. Create a draft version of the AgDxAPI standardized web service API specification for data exchange.
5. Lead the review of the specification in a (virtual) workshop of all stakeholders. The workshop will provide feedback and provide input for the finalization of the first version of the specification.
6. Document the AgDXAPI using widely accepted API documentation standards

## Deliverables

1. List of minimum data elements suitable for exchange between the pest and disease databases and applications
2. Harmonization of the minimum data elements with existing data standards and ontologies
3. AgDxAPI standardized web service API specification published on the AgDx Alliance Github
4. Documentation of the AgDxAPI including on online API documentation systems such as Apiary and Swagger
